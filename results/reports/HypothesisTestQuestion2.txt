HypothesisTestQuestion 2.A: Construct Hypothesis Test that measurement standard deviation differ from 0.01 grams?
	 H_0: sigma^2=0.01^2 
	 H_1: sigma^2 != 0.01^2 
	 alpha=0.05 
	 s2:0.008306623862918047 	 df:14 	 ch2_0:1162.9273408085264 	 chi2_1_alpha_n_1:5.628726103039731 	 chi2_alpha_n_1:26.11894804503737
	 Reject H_0: There is sufficient evidence that measurement standard deviation differ from 0.01 grams
HypothesisTestQuestion 2.B: Obtain P-Value for Hypothesis Test that measurement standard deviation differ from 0.01 grams?
	 H_0: sigma^2=0.01^2 
	 H_1: sigma^2 != 0.01^2 
	 alpha=0.05 
	 pval:0
