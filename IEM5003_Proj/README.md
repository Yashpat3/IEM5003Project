# IEM 5003 Programming Assignment

### Code Components

This repository contains code designed to help you finish the Programming Assignment for IEM 5003. It consists of the following folders:

- `data`
    
    This folder contains the data needed to run the Python code. Specifically, it has the datasets `liver_data` and `wine_quality`. 
    Both data sets have been provided in the CSV format and comprise of a training and a testing datasets as well. Explore the data carefully before beginning the project. 
  - Liver data pertains to variables for blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption. The idea is to build a model that can predict the number of drinks in terms of half pints (6th column) a person must consume so as to encounter the blood test results given as indepependent variables.
  - Wine data pertains to various markers typically characterizing wine that could be indicative of the quality.    

- `results/reports`
    
    This folder will contain output plots of graphs. The graphs will be automatically be written to this folder. Feel free to use different colors, markers, sizes etc to create graphs and plots.
    
- `reports/plots`
    
    This folder contains output reports from the running the Python code. The reports contain various aspects of the Logistic and Linear Regression models for each of the cases as well as outputs of the Hypothesis Tests. 

- `example_results`

    This folder contains examples for how plots and reports must look like.

The repository also contains the following files:

- `Driver.py`
    
    **This is the main file that you need to run and will be interacting with. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE** You will need to populate the following files at points marked with TODO.

- `HypothesisTests.py`
   This file contains two hypothesis tests problems. Implement the various statements pertaining to the tests in each function.

- `LinearRegression.py`
    
    This is the file which is responsible for carrying out LinearRegression. Read the file carefully. You are required to populate the following functions:
    
    - `linearRegression(self,X,y)` : This consumes the data points `X` and `y` which comes from the `evaluateRegressor` function. You are required to do the following steps:
        - Do linear regression using any Python package.
        - Obtain the coefficient of determination/score/R^2 value.
        - Obtain the regression parameters
        - Calculate predicted values
        
        The function must output four values:
        
        - `reg` : This is the Python object that holds the regression model. This must have a utility like `reg.predict(X)`.
        - `score` : This is the R2 value.
        - `params` : This is the parameters of the model.
        - `y_pred` : This is the prediction of y on test data.
    - `computeResiduals(self,y_pred,y)` : This function must compute the residuals given `y_pred` and `y` and output the `residuals` vector.
    - `computeSSE(self,residuals)`: This function computes the SSE score given the residual vector and returns it using the variable `SSE`
    - `computeSSR(self,y_pred,y)`: This function must compute the SSR given `y_pred` and `y` and return the SSR using the variable `SSR`
    - `computeFScore(self,alpha,k,n,p)`: This function computes the F-Score by taking as input the following values:
        - `alpha`: The level of significance
        - `k` : The number of regression parameters.
        - `p` : The number of parameters to estimate.
        - `n`: The total number of rows.
        
        The function returns the the F Score in the variable `f`
        
    - `computeFTestStatistic(self,y_pred,y,residuals,alpha,k,n,p)` : This function computes the F test statistic by taking as input the following values:
        - `y_pred` : The predictor that the code learnt before.
        - `y` : The response variable.
        - `residuals` : The residual value computed before.
        - `alpha`: The level of significance
        - `k` : The number of regression parameters.
        - `p` : The number of parameters to estimate.
        - `n`: The total number of rows.
        
        The function returns the the F Score in the variable `f`. 

        ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind that you would need to use the functions `computeSSE` and `computeSSR` inside this function in order to compute the F statistic.**
        
    - `computepValue(self,test_statistic,alpha,k,n,p)` : This function computes the p-value given the test statistic provided in `computeFTestStatistic` by taking as input the following values:

        - `p` : The number of parameters to estimate.
        - `n`: The total number of rows.
        
        The function returns the p-value stored in the variable `p-value`
        
    - `predictNewObservations(self,lin_reg,X)`: This function must compute the predictions using the `lin_reg` object obtained from the `linearRegression` function. It takes as input the following variables:
        - `X` : This is the the X values on which you would need to predict on.
        - `lin_reg` : The Python Regression object obtained from the `linearRegression` function.

    - `Plotting.py`
        This file contains all the functions needed for plotting scatter plots, histograms and box plots. 
        You need not plot all combination of values, just the ones present in the file should be sufficient. Only implement statements pertaining to the `#TODO:` markers. Keep in mind that you would need to label axes and make sure legends appear on the plots if any.

### Other Tips and Suggestions

Take a look at the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library available for Python. For statistical testing, take a look at [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html). Depending on your local Python environment, you might need to install various libraries. You can do that using `pip install <library_name>`

For plotting, take a look at [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

A popular option is to leverage Anaconda/Miniconda and creating a virtual environment. Please take a look at [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) .

ðŸ’¡ **You could run, edit and develop the code in multiple ways. Either you can use an IDE such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/). You could use a Jupyter notebook to run and edit code.  Or you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run your experiments.**
